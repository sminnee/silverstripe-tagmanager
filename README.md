# SilverStripe Tag Manager

SilverStripe's server-side answer to Google/Adobe Tag Manager!

SilverStripe tag manager provides a framework for adding programmatically-generated snippets of HTML to pages on your site.
Examples include tracking codes for analytics and other packages and meta-tags.

To get full benefit of tag manager you should find or create modules that provide such snippets. CMS administrators can use
the Tag Manager admin section to enable and configure these snippets.
